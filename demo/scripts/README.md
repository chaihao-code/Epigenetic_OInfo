# demo/scripts

Analysis programs or support modules for the parent workflow. O-information arithmetic is provided only by common/02_oinformation/compute_hoi_oinfo.py.

## Inputs

See the files/subdirectories below and the parent README. Coordinate inputs use zero-based, half-open genomic intervals; signal lists use repository-root-relative paths. Read `docs/PATHS.md` for external-input restoration.

## Usage

Run commands from the repository root and set `EPINFO_ROOT` to that root. For the shortest verified workflow, follow `demo/README.md`. For a case command preview, use `python tools/plan_oinfo.py --case <case> --sample <sample>`. Program CLI options are listed below where present.

- `prepare_from_bigwig.py`: `python demo/scripts/prepare_from_bigwig.py --help`; options include `--output`, `--workers`.

## Outputs

Each script writes the result/figure paths declared in its source. New O-information runs write all-subset entropy, observed Omega/TC/DTC, a permutation summary and metadata; triplet-null runs also write a BH-corrected significance table. Local/sampled-bin exports are enabled with `--save-local-oinfo --save-sampled-bins`.
